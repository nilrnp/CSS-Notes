Absolute Units (are a fixed size):
- pixels (px)

Percentages:
- Usually for widths 
- Relative to their parents 

Relative Units:
- em (relative to the size of the parent); if parent has size of 3px, 1em on child would also be 3px, 2em would be 2*3px
- rem (relative to the html element that was set previously; html { fontsize: 10px}, 1.5rem would be 10px*1.5)

Widths (can set different widths based on screen size):
- min-width 
- max-width 

General rule of thumb:
- font size: rems 
- Padding and margin: ems 
- Widths: ems or percents
